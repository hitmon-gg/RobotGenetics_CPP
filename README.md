## Problem

You are going to reproduce an experiment first conducted at Harvard University in 1968. This program studies the effects of evolution on a population of robots. The robots need to maneuver around a grid collecting energy. The robots must collect more energy than they expend to survive. Your robots will maneuver around a 10 x 10 grid looking for batteries. A battery gives the robot give more power. Moving a square costs 1 power. The sensors are always on and cost no power. Robots have five power when they first emerge on the map.

Each Robot has a collection of direction sensors and a motor. Robot success depends upon the map between these two elements. The robots start with random mapping, but over time, the mappings evolve into successful strategies.
